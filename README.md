# Interpreter

This is an interpreter for my own programming language written in Python. It uses recursive descent parsing and visitor pattern AST traversing.

The language includes features such as arithmetic operations, variable assignments, conditional flow, iterative and while loops, arrays, function declarations and calls, and scopes.

The documentation for the language will be available soon.
