# Interpreter

This is an interpreter for my own programming language written in Python. It uses recursive descent parsing and visitor pattern AST traversing.

The language includes features such as arithmetic operations, variable assignments, conditional flow, iterative and while loops, arrays, function declarations and calls, and scopes.

The documentation for the language will be available soon.

As of right now the language is fully interpreter and is written in Python with little optimizations. I plan to use LLVMLite for python to compile it instead to make the run time faster.
